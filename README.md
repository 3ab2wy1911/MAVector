## The idea of the code
* Creating a Vector Container in C++ using templates.
## Features that our vector support :
* Declaring empty vector with initializing capacity.
* Declaring and initializing vector from an array.
* Declaring and initializing vector from another vector.
* Accessing elements inside the vector using operator [].
* Push_back, pop_back, and clear functions.
* Iterators and some functions using iterators like erase and insert.
* Comparison operations like == and >.
* Ostream operator <<.
* and many other features...
